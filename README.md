# PJ Notification

**PJ Notification** is open-source **unofficial** Android application.
PJ Noticifation is for people who wants to get push alarmed course notifications for YSCEC.

  
## From Motivation to Creation
For many years, there was no official Android application for YSCEC which pushes alarm for course notifications.
For me, it is uncomfortable to login and check whether there is a new course notifications everytime.
Also, I sometimes encountered the situation that everybody knows about the notice except for me because I did not check the notice frequently.
I always wanted to make a easier way to check the course notifications.
I thought Android application is the best option because it can push alarm so that I do not have to login and check manually.
However, I had only a little knowledge about the Android so I had no way to realize my thoughts.

In 1st semester, 2019, I applied for a leave of absence from university.
While I was talking with my friend, I was motivated by him to create an Android application.
At that time, I had enough time to do that, so I just started while worrying about fail.

Even though there was some obstacles, I finally created one and published it in 27th, May, 2019.
